## Gender Detection by Image Processing
### Project Summary:
The paper seeks to investigate the effectiveness of LDA and SVM classifications for classifying people's face images based on gender. Prior to classifying, PCA is applied to the images to reduce their dimensions.
The database provided consists of 400 facial images of different people, selected from different races with different facial expressions and in variable light conditions (200 images of men and 200 images of women). The size of each image is 60x48.
